# WORKOUT B: 3/7 METHOD

## Warm-up (5-7 minutes)
- 5 minutes light cardio (treadmill/bike/rowing)
- Dynamic stretching for major muscle groups
- 1 light set at 50% working weight for first exercise

## Instructions
- For each exercise, perform sets of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 reps
- Rest exactly 20-30 seconds between each set
- Focus on proper form, especially during later sets
- Track weights used and adjust as needed

## Exercise Sequence

### 1. KETTLEBELL SWINGS (replacing Barbell Deadlift)
- **Weight:** 24-32kg kettlebell
- **Sets:** 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 reps
- **Rest:** 20-30 seconds between sets
- **Form Cues:** Hip hinge, power from posterior chain, tight core
- **Notes:** Superior to deadlifts for conditioning, explosive power, and reduced spinal loading

### 2. CHEST SUPPORTED ROW
- **Machine:** 57.5kg
- **Sets:** 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 reps
- **Rest:** 20-30 seconds between sets
- **Form Cues:** Full scapular retraction, keep chest against pad, control descent
- **Notes:** Focus on squeezing shoulder blades together at peak contraction

### 3. BULGARIAN SPLIT SQUAT
- **Weight:** 17.5kg dumbbells (each hand)
- **Sets:** 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 reps (per leg)
- **Rest:** 20-30 seconds between sets (after both legs completed)
- **Form Cues:** Vertical torso, front knee tracking over toe, balance and control
- **Notes:** Complete all sets for one leg before switching to maintain intensity

### 4. INCLINE DUMBBELL PRESS
- **Weight:** 30kg dumbbells (each hand)
- **Sets:** 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 reps
- **Rest:** 20-30 seconds between sets
- **Form Cues:** Retract shoulder blades, neutral wrist position, control descent
- **Notes:** Consider varying the bench angle slightly between workouts

### 5. DUMBBELL LATERAL RAISES
- **Weight:** 17.5kg dumbbells (each hand)
- **Sets:** 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 reps
- **Rest:** 20-30 seconds between sets
- **Form Cues:** Slight forward lean, thumbs slightly higher than pinkies, control movement
- **Notes:** Consider dropping weight if form deteriorates in later sets

### 6. OVERHEAD TRICEP EXTENSIONS
- **Weight:** 20kg (replacing incline kickbacks for better overall development)
- **Sets:** 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 reps
- **Rest:** 20-30 seconds between sets
- **Form Cues:** Keep elbows close to head, full extension without locking out, control descent
- **Notes:** Can be performed with dumbbell, cable, or rope attachment

### 7. HIGH TO LOW CHEST CABLE FLIES
- **Weight:** 36kg each side
- **Sets:** 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 reps
- **Rest:** 20-30 seconds between sets
- **Form Cues:** Slight forward lean, maintain tension throughout, squeeze at bottom
- **Notes:** Focus on chest contraction rather than just moving the weight

## Cool Down
- Light stretching for worked muscle groups (2-3 minutes)
- Track workout performance in log

## Progressive Overload Plan
- Increase weights by 2.5kg when you can complete all sets with good form
- For kettlebell swings, focus on power and form before increasing weight
- If unable to complete all reps in later sets, maintain weight until stronger
